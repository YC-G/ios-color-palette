Resolved Bugs:
1. DetailViewController shows the same page for every cell -> Didn't use DispatchQueue to catch information sent from segue in DetailViewController
2. UI components added programmatically overlap with components added on storyboards -> Wrap textview added programmatically in a header 
3. Color data is refreshed everytime return from other pages -> initialize color data in ViewDidLoad() instead of ViewWillAppear()
4. Thread: key not found for a deleted IBoutlet -> Delete the IBoutlet in the code of storyboard
5. View added to storyboard doesn't show up -> constraints and aspect 1:1

Unresolved Bugs:
1. Can't return from web kit if screen orientation is changed
2. Navigate to the NewColorViewController
